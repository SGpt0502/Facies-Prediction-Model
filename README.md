Geological facies is a term generally used to refer to different types of rock bodies with some specific characteristics. Physical properties such as porosity, permeability, grain size, etc., composition, or any other attributes can be used to distinguish facies from each other.Identifying facies types is one of the important aspects for well-placement and production planning, reservoir characterization and modeling, etc. Conventional log data analysis techniques to predict facies type manually requires lots of time and human expertise, especially in long holes with a great variety of stratified lithologies. The significance of this project revolves around utilizing 
the heavy computational power of machines for complex calculations on larger data sets to predict facies type automatically, so as to improve accuracy and reduce human efforts. The model is based on the wireline well logs data from a class exercise of the University of Kansas, which contains the record of radioactivity, neutron porosity, 
density porosity, photoelectric factor, etc. corresponding to different rocks per foot inside the wells. Certain machine learning algorithms have been used to train the model using data from ten different wells before it becomes ready to assign one category or the other to the facies of any new well.
